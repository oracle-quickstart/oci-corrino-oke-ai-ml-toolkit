## IAM Policies

Many Corrino users choose to give full admin access to Corrino when using it for the first time or developing a POC, and making the permissions more granular overtime. We provide you with two different variations of IAM Policies for you to choose from - depending on your situation.

## Step 1: Create Dynamic Group in Identity Domain
Inside the OCI console:
1. Open the **navigation menu** and select **Identity & Security**. Under **Identity**, select **Domains**.
2. Select the identity domain you want to work in and select **Dynamic Groups**.
3. Enter the following information:
	* **Name:** A unique name for the group. The name must be unique across all groups in your tenancy (dynamic groups and user groups). You can't change the name later. Avoid entering confidential information.
	* **Description:** A friendly description.
4. Enter the following **Matching rules**. Resources that meet the rule criteria are members of the group:
```
All {instance.compartment.id = '<corrino_compartment_ocid>'}
```
(Substituting the actual compartment ocid where Corrino will be deployed in place of `<corrino_compartment_ocid>`)

5. Select Create.

More info on dynamic groups can be found here: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/dynamicgroups/To_create_a_dynamic_group.htm

## Step 2: Add IAM Policies To Root Compartment

* **Note:** `'IdentityDomainName'/'DynamicGroupName'` -> please modify this to match the dynamic group that you created in Step 1 above
* **Note:** All these policies will be in the root compartment of your tenancy (NOT in the Corrino compartment itself)
*  **Note:** If you are not an admin of your tenancy, then you will need to have an admin add the following policies for the dynamic group AND the user group that your user belongs if you are the one that will be deploying Corrino (aka you will have the admin create the policies below twice - once for the dynamic group you created in Step 1 and once for the user group that your user belongs to)

**Option #1: Full Admin Access:**

```
Allow dynamic-group 'IdentityDomainName'/'DynamicGroupName' to inspect all-resources in tenancy
Allow dynamic-group 'IdentityDomainName'/'DynamicGroupName' to manage all-resources in compartment {comparment_name}
```

**Option #2: Fine-Grain Access:**
